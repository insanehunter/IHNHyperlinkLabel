IHNHyperlinkLabel
=================

This is a simple `UILabel` subclass to simulate hyperlink behaviour - underlined text becoming highlighted on touch and sending notification to its delegate.

## Usage

Create a new label in Interface Builder, set highlight color, shadow color & offset and bind the `delegate` property. Change label's class to `IHNHyperlinkLabel` and you're done!
